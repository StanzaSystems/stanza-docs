# Concepts

## General

### Feature
A feature of your software - like 'product search', 'checkout' or 'settings'

### Priority
An assigned number from 0-10 that defines the priority of a feature. Priority 0 features are highest prioirty, and priority 10 features are lowest. Features not assigned a prioirty are defaulted to 5.

### Service
Code that you maintain that is in a separate binary/runs independant of other code. Typically a 'Micro-service' in industry.

### Third-Party Service
A service your code calls, but that you do not maintain the code for. Examples are Stripe, RDS, GitHub, Firebase.

### Environment
An environment of servers/deployments you maintain, either for production or for testing. 'dev', 'qa', 'prod', etc.

### Project
Projects are simple grouping buckets to make things easy to search for and assign security permissions to. You will assign all features and services to a project.

## Back-End

### Decorator

### Token Bucket

### QPS

## UI Concepts

### Stanza Config
The [Stanza Config](./javascript/stanzaconfig) defines the configuration for Stanza in the browser - including things like API key, environment, and context.

### Context 
A context is a group of features that you would like to load, store and refresh together. Most likely they are on the same page, or within the same route.

### Enablement Number 
Because Stanza stops requests from happening to manage load, it also must have a safe way to restart them. Restarting all requests at once creates a potentially dangerous [thundering herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) problem as they all slam in.
Instead, traffic is re-enabled over time. To do this, clients are randomly assigned an `enablement number` between 0 and 99. Clients with a low enablement number will have requests re-enabled before clients with a high one.

If you don't want to worry about this, you don't have to. However, the UI toolkit provides an override in case you want to ensure some customers are re-enabled first. Just remember to keep the distibution fairly even or the thundering herd comes back!
