# Configuring Decorators

## Quota Configurations
Decorator behavior is configured using the Quota Configuration. By default, your decorator was created with an empty traffic configuration that you can modify to meet your needs.
There are many quota configuration options - read the [configuration section for more information](/configuration/decorators.mdx)

## Optional Configurations
Decorators have two optional configurations that are for your records:
1. [Traffic Type](/glossary#decorator)
2. Guarded Service - the service that the decorator guards (if this is an 'outbound' traffic decorator, it will not be the same as the service the decorator is in.)
