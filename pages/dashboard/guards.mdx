# Configuring Guards

## Quota Configurations
Guard behavior is configured using the Quota Configuration. By default, your guard was created with an empty traffic configuration that you can modify to meet your needs.
There are many quota configuration options - read the [configuration section for more information](/configuration/guards.mdx)

## Optional Configurations
Guards have two optional configurations that are for your records:
1. [Traffic Type](/glossary#guard)
2. Guarded Service - the service that the guard guards (if this is an 'outbound' traffic guard, it will not be the same as the service the guard is in.)
