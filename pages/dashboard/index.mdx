The stanza dashboard is how you tell Stanza about your deployments and administer your use of the product.

Navigation on the dashboard is achieved using the menu on the left hand side. 

Features, Services and Guards are core to what stanza does, for help setting them up select what you need from this list:
- Creating [Features](dashboard/features)

You can use the Administration top level menu to create projects and environments to help you organise your use of Features, Services and Guards.

The creation of API and Browser keys is also under Administration.
