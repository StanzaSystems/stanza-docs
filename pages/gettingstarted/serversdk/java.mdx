# Getting Started with Java Server-Side

To use [Java SDK](https://github.com/StanzaSystems/sdk-java) in spring boot application:

- Add "org.stanza.spring" to you component scan.
- Wrap you code and the entire method call will be executed with the stanza protection. 

To wrap the code you can use the annotation: 

```java 
@StanzaHandler(decorator = "Stripe_Products_API_Sentinel", feature = "sentinel")
``` 

`decorator` parameter is mandatory and `feature` is optional for this annotation.

You can inject `StanzaSpringWrapper` class and use its method: 

```java
handle(Supplier<V> supplier, String decorator)
``` 
or 
```java
handle(Supplier<V> supplier, String decorator, String feature)
``` 
to wrap any block of the code with supplier lambda. 

In this case only wrapped block of code will be protected with stanza guard. 

You should use `StanzaOkHttpClient` in you code to communicate with the 3d services. 

It is required to make stanza protection work correctly in multi-service environment.
