# Getting Started with Stanza in Node.js

Stanza provides an SDK implementation to integrate Stanza functionalities into a Node application.

## Install the Stanza Node SDK

```shell
npm install @getstanza/node

# or
# yarn add @getstaza/node
```

## Initialize Stanza

To initialize the Stanza SDK add the following script to your application eg. `initStanza.js`

```js
import { init } from '@getstanza/node'

init({
  hubUrl: '<url-to-hub>', // eg. https://hub.dev.getstanza.dev:9020
  apiKey: '<valid-api-key>', // can be set up in Stanza UI
  serviceName: '<service-name>', // eg. DemoCommerce (needs to be configured in Stanza UI)
  serviceRelease: '<service-release>',
  environment: '<environment>' // eg. local (needs to be configured in Stanza UI)
})
```

Stanza Node SDK needs to be initialized before you load any other scripts in order to work correctly.
* You can either load it using `-r` parameter in node
```shell
node -r initStanza.js app.js
```
* or import it at the beginning of you app file ie. `app.js`
```js
require('./initStanza')

/*
  your app code
*/
```

## Wrapping code with a decorator

One of the main features of Stanza is the ability to guard the execution of your code by wrapping it with a decorator. If you want to learn more about what decorators are please read our [glossary](../glossary) page first.

Let's imaging the following block of code:

```js
console.log('About to call a service')
await aService.doSomething()
console.log('Service returned successfully')
```

If we want to guard this block of code with a Stanza decorator we can first [create and configure a decorator in the stanza UI](/configuration/decorators). 

Then we can define it in code:

```js
const myDecorator = stanzaDecorator({ decorator: 'my-decorator' })
```

And then we can wrap the code with this decorator:

```js
await myDecorator.call(async () => {
  console.log('About to call a service')
  await aService.doSomething()
  console.log('Service returned successfully')
})
```

Now the code wrapped with a decorator will only get executed if all checks enforced by a decorator (requesting for quota, validating the incoming token etc.) are satisfied. Otherwise, it will reject with a StanzaError describing the cause of the execution being blocked.

As an alternative we can wrap an existing function, let's call it `myFunction`, and wrap it to be reused later.

```js
async function myFunction() {
  console.log('My function starts')
  await doSomething()
  console.log('Service returned successfully')
}
```

In order to wrap it we can use the same decorator instance as above, but use a `bind` method instead:

```js
const myGuardedFunction = myDecorator.bind(myFunction)
```

In this example we don't call the `myFunction` immediately but wrap it with another function that can be reused and called later

```js
/*
  This will first verify all the conditions enforced by a decorator and only execute `myFunction` if they are satisfied.
 */
myGuardedFunction()
```
### Debug Mode
The Stanza Node.js SDK has a debug mode that can be enabled to get additional output.
Set an environment variable:
```
STANZA_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

The debug mode uses Pino under the hood. If you want fewer logs, you can also set the log level higher according to the [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#level-string) log levels.
