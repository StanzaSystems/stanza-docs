# Getting Started with Python

Stanza provides a Python SDK with adapters for easy integration with popular libraries. This SDK
is open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/StanzaSystems/sdk-python

## Install the SDK

The Stanza Python SDK is available at PyPi as [getstanza](https://pypi.org/project/getstanza/).
You can install the latest version with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```shell
pip install getstanza
```

The same will also work for any Python package manager which supports PyPi, such as
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org):

```shell
poetry add getstanza
```

## Initialize Stanza

The Stanza Python SDK provides adapters (currently supporting FastAPI,
Requests, and SQS) to ease integration, but even without an adapter you can
initialize Stanza to "[Guard](/glossary#guard)" any generic resource:

```python
from getstanza.client import StanzaClient
from getstanza.configuration import StanzaConfiguration
 
# Init Stanza fault tolerance library
try:
    client = StanzaClient(
        StanzaConfiguration(
            api_key="YOUR-API-KEY-HERE",  # or via STANZA_API_KEY environment variable
            service_name=NAME,            # or via STANZA_SERVICE_NAME environment variable
            service_release=RELEASE,      # or via STANZA_SERVICE_RELEASE environment variable
            environment=ENV,              # or via STANZA_ENVIRONMENT environment variable
        )
    )
except ValueError as exc:
    logging.exception(exc)
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Adapters

#### FastAPI

For a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) server use the
`getstanza_fastapi` adapter:

```python
from getstanza_fastapi.fastapi_client import StanzaFastAPIClient
from getstanza.configuration import StanzaConfiguration

# Init Stanza fault tolerance library
try:
    client = StanzaFastAPIClient(
        StanzaConfiguration(
            api_key="YOUR-API-KEY-HERE",  # or via STANZA_API_KEY environment variable
            service_name=NAME,            # or via STANZA_SERVICE_NAME environment variable
            service_release=RELEASE,      # or via STANZA_SERVICE_RELEASE environment variable
            environment=ENV,              # or via STANZA_ENVIRONMENT environment variable
        )
    )
except ValueError as exc:
    logging.exception(exc)
    sys.exit(1)
```

#### SQS

For a service guarding outbound [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) use the
`getstanza_sqs` adapter:

```python
from getstanza_sqs import StanzaSQSClient
from getstanza.configuration import StanzaConfiguration

# Init Stanza fault tolerance library
try:
    client = StanzaSQSClient(
        StanzaConfiguration(
            api_key="YOUR-API-KEY-HERE",  # or via STANZA_API_KEY environment variable
            service_name=NAME,            # or via STANZA_SERVICE_NAME environment variable
            service_release=RELEASE,      # or via STANZA_SERVICE_RELEASE environment variable
            environment=ENV,              # or via STANZA_ENVIRONMENT environment variable
        )
    )
except ValueError as exc:
    logging.exception(exc)
    sys.exit(1)
```

## Leverage Stanza

Guards are Stanza's most powerful concept. Guards can wrap any arbitrary code
path with various behaviors to improve reliability. Guards also collect
telemetry about the performance of the wrapped code path which is visible to
you in the Stanza Dashboard. See [Dashboard > Guards](/dashboard/guards) for
instructions on how to create a new Stanza Guard.

### Inbound Guards

Stanza Inbound Guards intercept a service's incoming (ingress) traffic in order
to protect the service from overload.

The simplest way to use an Inbound Guard is with one of our adapters. For
example, if you are using FastAPI, you would [initialize with the
`getstanza_fastapi` adapter](#fastapi) and decorate a path with a Stanza Guard:

```python
app = FastAPI(title=NAME, version=RELEASE, debug=DEBUG)

@app.get("/something")
@client.stanza_guard("GuardName")
async def something():
    # âœ… Stanza Guard has *allowed* this workflow, business logic goes here.
```

### Outbound Guards

Stanza Outbound Guards intercept a services outbound (egress) traffic in order
to protect *that* service from overload.

The simplest way to use an Outbound Guard is with one of our adapters. For
example, if you are using AWS SQS you would [initialize with the
`getstanza_sqs` adapter](#sqs) and decorate a path with a Stanza Guard:

```python
sqs = boto3.resource("SomeResource")
queue = client.stanza_guard(
    sqs.get_queue_by_name(QueueName="QueueName"), "GuardName"
)
```

To guard outbound HTTP with Requests use the `getstanza_requests` adapter:

```python
from getstanza_requests import StanzaSession

try:
    with StanzaSession("GuardName") as session:
        resp = session.get("https://some.url/path", timeout=10)
```

## Debug Mode

The Stanza Python SDK has a debug mode that can be enabled to get additional
output. Set an environment variable:

```shell
STANZA_DEBUG=true
```
