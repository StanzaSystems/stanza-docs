Stanza is an experience aware reliability tool. Stanza can help you do things like manage rate limits, prevent database overloads, or gracefully degrade a UI with clear messages - all in a way that puts user need first!

# How to get started.

If you're new here and want to understand the core concepts, [start here](./howItWorks).

If you're ready to build, select the path that matches your need. 
- [Use Browser Integration](./gettingStarted/Browser/Javascript) to control the traffic users send you and react to your current challenges.
- Improve the reliability and resiliency of your microservices. [[JS](./gettingStarted/Microservices/Javascript)/[Go](./gettingStarted/Microservices/go)/[Java](./gettingStarted/Microservices/java)]
- Protect your a [SaaS](./gettingStarted/SaaS/SaaS) (GitHub, Stripe, AWS Lambda) or [DB](./gettingStarted/SaaS/SaaS) (Redis/SQL) from exceeding usage limits.

# Why Use Stanza?
Stanza solves a lot of common reliability problems. It does this in a way that most benefits the users of your software.

We can help if you have had problems with:
- rate-limited services like Stripe, Shopify or GitHub
- Ensuring the most important parts of your application continue to work during high load
- Protecting Redis/Postgres from instability and errors caused by high load.

We can help you if you'd like the capability to:
- Gracefully degrade user interfaces when underlying services like caches or database replicas are impaired
- Communicating with users about what is happening - right in the application.

Any time you've reliability or scaling challenges caused by user behavior or traffic, we can help.
