# What is Stanza? 
Stanza is an experience aware reliability tool. Stanza can help you do things like manage rate limits, prevent database overloads, or gracefully degrade a UI with clear messages - all in a way that puts user need first!

# How to get started.

If you're new here and want to understand the core concepts, [start here](./howItWorks).

If you're ready to build, select the path that matches your need. 
- Use [Browser Integration](./gettingStarted/Browser/Javascript) to control the traffic users send you and react to your current challenges.
- Improve the reliability and resiliency of your microservices. [[JS](./gettingStarted/Microservices/Javascript)/[Go](./gettingStarted/Microservices/go)/[Java](./gettingStarted/Microservices/java)]
- Protect your a [SaaS](./gettingStarted/SaaS/SaaS) (GitHub, Stripe, AWS Lambda) or [DB](./gettingStarted/SaaS/SaaS) (Redis/SQL) from exceeding usage limits. 
- [API documentation for Developers](https://stanza.stoplight.io/docs/apis/branches/main/291a2cff9d156-stanza-hub-api)
