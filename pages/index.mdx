# Introduction

Stanza makes user interface aware reliability tools. Stanza can help you do things like manage rate limits, prevent database overlaods, or message users during an outage - all in a way that puts user need first!

# Why Use Stanza?

We know, `User Interface Aware Reliability Tools` is kind of a mouthful! But Stanza solves a lot of common reliability problems in software today, in a way that most benefits the users of your software.

If you have had problems with:
- 429 errors from a rate-limited service like Stripe, Shopify or GitHub
- Ensuring the most important parts of your application continue to work during high traffic
- Needing to restart services like Redis at high load due to unexplained errors
- Wanting to temporarily disable UI components when underlying services have failed
- Simply needing to tell users what is happening - right where they are looking, and not on Twitter

There is a good chance Stanza can help you!
