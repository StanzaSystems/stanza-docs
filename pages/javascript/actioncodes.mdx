# Action Codes
Action codes are commands issued to the UI to adapt to system stress. The UI is one of the most powerful tools for system stress adaptation because it can simultaneously give the user a fast and informative experience, and stop requests at the source - alleviating system pressure.

0. No action

1. Disabled/Visible
- Action to keep a UI element in place but disable it from working
- This action may or may not have an accompanying message

2. Remove
- Action to remove a UI element from the view of the user, and stop sending any requests related to that UI element. Remove actions may have an accompanying message to display in place.

3. Cache (Coming Soon!)
- Add a cache control header if it's not there
- Make it longer if it is
